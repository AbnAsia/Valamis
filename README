The project is an implementation of the SCORM set of standards for e-learning for the Liferay portal. Supported Liferay version is currently 6.0.5 CE.
The targeted version of SCORM is 2004 4th edition.
All server-side code is written using the Scala programming language for the JVM.

The current implementation is only able do display static SCORM content with respect towards the different content organizations and the activity structure in each organization.

Administrative features let you manage SCORM packages, uploading the them in standard zipped format.
The user interface is available in two forms - a standalone web application, which may be deployed against  any servlet container, and a JSR-compliant portlet, which may be deployed against a standards-based portlet container. The portlet version has been tested on Liferay, but does not depend on its specific features.

The solution uses its own PostgreSQL database. You only need it created and accessible, there's an admin feature that lets you initialize the database structure before use.

If deployed against a servlet container, the end-user features are available at the relative url 'index.html', and the admin features are available at the relative url 'scorm_admin.html'.

If deployed against a portlet container, the end-user features are available via the portlet's standard View mode, while administrative features are available via the Edit mode.

The solution will be further developed to support the full set of requirements from the SCORM set of standards.
