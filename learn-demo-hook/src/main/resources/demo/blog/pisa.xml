    Finnish students have had good performance on PISA survey year after year. Read about background for Finnish PISA success from <a href="http://www.oph.fi/english/sources_of_information/pisa">Finnish National Board of Education </a></p>

Can organizations learn something about reasons behind Finlands PISA success?</p>
